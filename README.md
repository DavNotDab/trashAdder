# trashAdder
A small program that adds trash invisible characters to a provided text. Ideally to avoid copy-paste from lecturing materials. In three different languages!


You can specify the name of the file you want to insert the characters on in the config.json file "filename" variable.
Also you can add as many trash characters you want to the "trashCharacters" array and it will insert them randomly.
